# Wolfensvelte 3D

Yes, it's a Svelte "port" of Wolfenstein 3D.

No, there's no WebGL, or canvas.

## What? Why? How?

> What do you mean, it's a Svelte port of Wolfenstein 3D?

Well, it's Wolfenstein 3D... but entirely rendered with Svelte! [1]

> _Why?_

A better question would be "why not?"

But, the primary reason this project exists is because of [Svelte Hack 2023](http://hack.sveltesociety.dev/). But also because it seemed very interesting to work on!

> How?

A lot of alcohol, and even more CSS 3D Transforms.

<sup>[1] it's not Wolfenstein 3D, of course. It's not 1:1, but it's familiar enough when you play. Plus, Wolfensvelte is a cool name.

## Overview

Wolfensvelte 3D is a Svelte reimagining of the classic PC game Wolfenstein 3D. The entire game is made up from HTML DOM elements that have CSS 3D transforms applied to render the graphics.

The only tech used can be summed up as: Svelte, HTML, (S)CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript.
